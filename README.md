# Adventure Logistics

Adventures in the wild can be very fun, healthy and fulfilling, but they can also be difficult to plan, dangerous and costly.

We're here to help strike the perfect balance to get you out there quickly and back safely.

## Safety first

For every living thing. The perfect adventure leaves everyone happy and well, and nature unperturbed.

One of our main objectives is to allow people to enjoy the Wild safely and without compromising it. As you plan your expedition, the system will use the information it has to guide you towards more environmentally appropriate practices where possible and help you avoid costly mistakes. We'll be continually improving  this based on our observations and input from the community. Furthermore, you can also customize this sub-system quite a bit.

## Users

Users get free access to a tool specifically designed for planning expeditions. Specifically the parts for which other solutions don't exist already. See [free features](/features).

Users with more specific needs can get access to more features for a fee. See [paid features]()

## More than users, a community

The community are essential as they provide all the information that can't be obtained automatically. Also, they are the whole point of the project as they are the primary users of the system!

The system allows members of the community to help each other out by sharing rides, finding skilled partners, sharing map annotations, offering local logistical help, recommending certain service providers or outlets, etc.

## A helping hand and watchful eye

As you are planning a trip, the system can observe and offer specific advice tailored to that activity/location/timeline/etc. So if you ask for recipe ideas, for example, the system would take into consideration how long the food must be conserved, and in what kind of conditions, making the default suggestions more pertinent. Let's looks at other examples:

- Why and how to apply the leave-no-trace principles, and what to bring to make that possible
- Information on the local fauna and flora along your itinerary (including dangers and remedies, opportunities, regulation, etc.)
- Propose a list of items to include in the first aid kits tailored to the activities planned
- Help with choosing the canoe/bicycle/etc that best fits the expedition.
- Calculate luggage volumes and weight and help avoid problems with luggage not fitting in vehicles
- Expose users to relevant first-aid techniques
- Offer health-related advice

## A platform for education

The organization also aims to become a hub for education via multiple routes

- Organizing and guiding expeditions for kids, immigrants, and other people who can't really do it on their own for various reasons
- Inviting interns every summer to learn about the outdoors, but also about software, marketing, or any of the activities the organization operates in
- Any document produced for internal use will be published externally as online educational materials
- Any conference or presentation prepared for internal use will be open to the public and/or accessible to outsiders online

## Company culture

The employees we want working with us have 3 things in common:
1. A love for the job(s) they will take on here
2. A love for the Great Outdoors
3. A good fit with the team

They get decent+ salaries, but truly amazing conditions. They work when they want, the amount of time they want, where they want (shared office space available), etc.

We will also organize trips in the wild that allow teleworking so we can do intensive sprints in ideal conditions.
