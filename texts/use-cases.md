# Use cases

## Itinerary Search

You're preparing a canoe trip and need to decide upon an itinerary. Use the itinerary search page to define your criteria:

### Filter
- May 19 8AM 2017 => May 22 23PM 2017
- max 4 hours drive from Montreal
- downstream only

### Sort
- minimize portages (anything > R2 = portage)
- maximize amount of rapids
- maximize Wilderness

## Wilderness Adventure planning

Easily collaborate on a logistical plan, a menu, etc. Get automated hints and checklists based on best practices. Design and enforce a reviewing strategy.

## Science expedition

Facts are at the heart of this system. If you get the facts wrong on where the oasis is, your trip across the desert will leave you quench-less. Let's help scientists do their trips and maybe they'll help us get our facts right too!

Behind facts are science. It is by far the most effective methodology where facts are concerned. But science can be very difficult, especially in the wild, and especially if you want to minimize your impact on the environment. This system could be useful for scientists to plan their own expeditions as well as to help them choose destinations with complex searches with access instructions and safety tips could come in handy! We can even book you a local guide. The community that I expect will evolve around this system already goes to all sorts of wild places with minimal impact on the environment. Perhaps it's also possible to pair the adventurers up with scientists who need to get to difficult places with equipment. This would be a couchsurfing-style agreement where things end up much cheaper for everyone.
