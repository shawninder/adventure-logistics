# Adventure Logistics

Plan your next wilderness adventure easily, quickly and safely.

Adventures in the wild can be very fun, healthy and fulfilling, but they can also be difficult to plan, dangerous and costly. We're here to help strike the perfect balance to get you out there quickly and back safely.

## Safety first

For every living thing. The perfect adventure leaves everyone happy and well, and nature unperturbed.

One of our main objectives is to allow people to enjoy the Wild safely and without compromising it. As you plan your expedition, the system will use the information it has to guide you towards safer and more environmentally appropriate practices thanks to useful information and tips relevant to your activity and location. We'll also be continually improving this based on your and the community's feedback.

## Users

Users get free access to a tool specifically designed for planning expeditions. Specifically the parts for which other solutions don't exist already. See [free features](/features#free-features).

Users with more specific needs can get access to more features for a fee. See [paid features](/features#paid-features)

## Customization

- plug-in architecture from the core out
- custom layouts and dashboards

## More than users, a community

The community are essential as they provide all the information that can't be obtained automatically. Also, they are the whole point of the project as they are the primary users of the system!

The system allows members of the community to help each other out by sharing rides, finding skilled partners, sharing map annotations, offering local logistical help, recommending certain service providers or outlets, etc.

## More than a community, communities!

Build communities around specific rivers, lakes, trails or complete itineraries to ensure they stay safe, clean and wild!

Or use the same set of community-oriented features to organize larger interventions protecting entire hydrographic basins or continental landmasses, this sub-project is intended to function similarly to StackExchange's Area 51, which allows new communities to be creating around specific intentions...

## Verified local contacts

- find local guides and drivers
- nearby rental locations
- hire someone to help with supply drops
- up-to-date lists of local emergency contacts and authorities

## A helping hand and watchful eye

As you are planning a trip, the system can observe and offer specific advice tailored to that activity/location/timeline/etc. So if you ask for recipe ideas, for example, the system would take into consideration how long the food must be conserved, and in what kind of conditions, making the default suggestions more pertinent. Let's looks at other examples:

- Why and how to apply the leave-no-trace principles, and what to bring to make that possible
- Information on the local fauna and flora along your itinerary (including dangers and remedies, opportunities, regulation, etc.)
- Propose a list of items to include in the first aid kits tailored to the activities planned
- Help with choosing the canoe/bicycle/etc that best fits the expedition.
- Calculate luggage volumes and weight and help avoid problems with luggage not fitting in vehicles
- Expose users to relevant first-aid techniques
- Offer health-related advice

## Offline Mode

You can prepare a digital kit to bring along on any device you have. This can include:
- digital files
  - maps
  - emergency protocols
  - contact list
  - local fauna and flora guide
  - music & movies
  - etc.
- offline-capable software
  - wheather instrument data analysis
  - mushroom or plant recognition
  - medical diagnosis
  - translation
  - morse transcoding

## Field Guide

Customize a field guid you can bring via offline mode or print to help you with:
- Local flora and fauna
- Local geology
- Local culture
- History of the region
- Information about current land custodians
- Information about current land owners

## A platform for education

The organization also aims to become a hub for education via multiple routes

- Organizing and guiding expeditions for kids, immigrants, and other people who can't really do it on their own for various reasons
- Inviting interns every summer to learn about the outdoors, but also about software, marketing, or any of the activities the organization operates in
- Any document produced for internal use will be published externally as online educational materials
- Any conference or presentation prepared for internal use will be open to the public and/or accessible to outsiders online

## New marketplaces

- plug-ins
- integrations
- affiliate sponsorship
- locals offering their services

## Company culture (when finances will permit)

The employees we want working with us have 3 things in common:
1. A love for the job(s) they will take on here
2. A love for the Great Outdoors
3. A good fit with the team

They get decent+ salaries, but truly amazing conditions. They work when they want, the amount of time they want, where they want (shared office space available), etc. They are expected to take on responsibilities and see things through to the end.

We will also organize trips in the wild that allow teleworking so we can do intensive sprints in ideal conditions.
