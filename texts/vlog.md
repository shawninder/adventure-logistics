# Adventure Logistics Updates

This series chronicles the development of a complex software project from unfunded idea to worldwide empire [citation required].

Short videos are sporadically published (at least one a month) detailing and demonstrating the progress made towards the advertised vision that is Adventure Logistics.

Along with the video updates, new web pages can be premiered here as well.
