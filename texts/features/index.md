# Features

Just as any feature can be turned on or off, proposed upcoming features can be advertised, commented upon, voted upon, sponsored and implemented!

They are very granular and it will sometimes be helpful to download a simple kind of feature that does nothing more than bundle multiple granular features together, for simplicity's sake.

Each feature provides its value by using core hooks to integrate with any part of the app environment. These hooks are granular as well and enforce strict and user-configurable permissions.

To help categorize the features, they can use any number of defined tags, which allow for single hashtag to be used for different things by selecting them also by their full description.
