# Missions
=======

This proposes missions which should help the crappier campsites / maps / trails out there become better. Just to be clear, better here means wilder, more sustainable, less maintenance needed, better encourages leave-no-trace practices.

Over time it will be a warning of the degrading areas, documenting the change in condition. On the contrary, it could also become a tool for measuring success!

## Example mission
- Cleaning up the trash
- Clearing out tent spots / trails / fire spots / swimming spots according to best practices (aim wild not tamed)
- Fixing / Cleaning / Creating fire pits
- Update data
  - photos (of rapids, entrances to campsites / portages / hiking trails from the river)
  - water levels
  - gps locations
  - rapid classification at different water levels


If you document the good you're doing, you get a reward since this creates useful data (photos, notes about conditions, etc.) and improves the condition of the site, of course!

The photos of the trash gathered are good marketing assets for a leave no trace movement. This should be accompanied by tips and tricks and stuff.
