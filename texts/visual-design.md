- The Nintendo analogy for plugin-style features: Use https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css and let installing features feel like putting a cassette into a Nintendo system. Preparing your offline mode experience can use the similar visual metaphor of choosing the cassettes you want to bring with your Gameboy (as opposed to a non-mobile SNES). This makes a dense configuration environment colourful and playful easily, and comes with well-known, simple iconography, as well as setting a clear target around which to develop further visual elements.
