# Jobs

In a nutshell, the main purpose of the company is create jobs of the highest quality: optimized for freedom.

The best job is not the highest paying job. It is the one where you learn, teach, experiment, contribute something useful to society and still have free time for fun, health, travel, relationships, life. It should feel superb to the employee, and to the community.
