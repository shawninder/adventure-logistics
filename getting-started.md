# Getting started

**Disclaimer:** Nothing can replace true knowledge and experience. This system is merely designed to help someone who knows what they are doing, or help them get in contact with someone who does.

There are a few ways to interact with the system:


- Provide information
- Publish information
  + Create and share calendars, lists, maps, etc.
- Request information ($)
  + Missing topographic maps
  - Missing service in an areas
- Setup notifications and the like
- Discover information
  + See the advice the system is recommending based on the information you provided and the information others or itself has published



## The system

There is no one way to use the system. You give the system information, it gives what it knows back. The more information you give, the more your get out of the system, so it also encourages providing more by offering it in the relevant places. For example, if you provide information about the participants of a trip and the shopping list for the day of the departure, the system might highlight known allergy risks so you can't forget.
