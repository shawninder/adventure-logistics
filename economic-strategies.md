# Economic strategies

This is an ambitious project and it is crucial to consider it's financial viability. To increase the chances of success, we propose the following ideas:

## Tracking

Correctly tracking expenses and revenues against predictions allows making better predictions with time, and better decisions in general. It also makes transparency trivial, and helps gain trust and even potentially help. In fact, anyone can opt-in to a notification when the system is running out of money ;)

## Appeal to good will

What we're doing is encouraging safety, the protection of the environment, fun, science, physical activity, collaboration, transparency, non-profit motives, etc. This is easy material to sell! It's not unreasonable to expect some level of success with:
- making it possible to pay for the free plan
- donations (including kickstarter, indiegogo, and the like)
- grants
- free publicity
- volunteering
- internships
- help from friends
- networking

## Appeal to the open source community

- Find more bugs
- Better scope genericness
- Better documentation
- Better testing
- Better code quality

## Keep load/traffic light or profitable
- Make large file storage a paid feature (just like github, possibly backed by github!). We freely host only text, meta and links, and not all of it (e.g. annotations are hosted by Hypothes.is)
- Reserve CPU intensive tasks for paying memberships, but then cache the results for everyone
- Reserve "open socket" features (live-streaming, real-time applications, etc.) to paid memberships
- Impose rate-limiting on free accounts, and then by usage.

## Delegate to free services

Delegate to other free services as much as possible

- youtube for videos
- Hypothes.is for annotations
- Stack Exchange for questions
- Wikipedia for knowledge
- You get the idea

## Partner with other service providers

- Referral money
- Free publicity

## Powerful branding

We're selling a way of life with a powerful message. It is well suited to beautiful imagery being concerned with people, nature, landscapes, maps, etc.

## Diversify sources of income

- Online services
- Physical services
- Products
- Events
- Donations and the like
- Referrals
- Affiliate advertisement
- Extremely targeted and localized advertisement
- Competitive travel insurance since we can charge you based on how prepared you are for your adventure...

## Publicity through impactful action

- Propose legislation to help the environment
- Organize civic action using the system
- Rent our custom gear cheap for relevant events
- Blacklist certain environmentally protected zones: the system refuses any unauthorized access to any data about those zones. You can't visit, even leave-no-trace style, like where un-contacted tribes live for example, or important archeological sites

## Reusing our time

- Take the time to build the quality we need, then sell what applies to others with the same needs
- Cleaning up our code for better maintainability, then using it as an example for documentation or in a tutorial
- Go have fun in the Wild, but also bring marketing material back and test a product and onboard an employee and cram as much value in there as possible
- Writing usage examples as test to make sure they are correct and cover all grounds from an intuitive standpoint

## Grow intelligently

Start without providing any locations for the business, working from the cloud and from coffeeshops and parks. Then get the office space when it makes sense.

## Design for low footprint

For example, let the user refine his search a little before performing it. Let the user do the calculations he needs on his own machine, etc.

## Keep the team small

Salaries are expensive. Keep the permanent core team small, even during growth, and rely on volunteers and contractors to accomplish specific goals where extra man-power is needed.

### The core team needs to cover
- operations: keep things up and runnings, fixing bugs, paying bills and salaries, keeping up with a changing world
- support: customer support, documentation fixes
- tracking: tracking finances, impacts, dependencies, traffic
- revenue: seek new clients, publicity, etc.
- development: keep the project on track with the roadmap
- lead: orchestrating the decision on the direction to lead the efforts in

### Can be covered by contractors

- Some development activities, like platform-specific work, translations, graphic design,
- Some of the testing
- Auditing, including security audits and penetration testing
- Distribution of physical goods
- Legal advice and action
- Shipping
- Real-estate inspections, purchases, leases

Note that contractors here includes free counsellors you sometimes get with some government programs
